This repository provides a **PyTorch-based reimplementation** of CrossFlow for the text-to-image generation task, with the following differences compared to the original paper:

- **Model Architecture**: The original paper utilizes DiMR as the model architecture. In contrast, this codebase supports training and inference with both [DiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT) (ICCV 2023, a widely adopted architecture) and [DiMR](https://github.com/qihao067/DiMR) (NeurIPS 2024, a state-of-the-art architecture).
- **Dataset**: The original model was trained on proprietary 350M dataset. In this implementation, the models are trained on open-source datasets, including [LAION-400M](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset/) and [JourneyDB](https://journeydb.github.io/).
- **LLMs**: The original model only supports CLIP as the language model, whereas this implementation includes models with CLIP and T5-XXL.

## Sampling

You can sample from the pre-trained CrossFLow model with the [`demo_t2i.py`](https://github.com/qihao067/CrossFlow/blob/main/demo_t2i.py). Before running the script, download the appropriate checkpoint and configure hyperparameters such as the classifier-free guidance scale, random seed, and mini-batch size in the corresponding configuration files.

To accelerate the sampling process, the script supports multi-GPU sampling. For example, to sample from the 512px CLIP DiMR-based CrossFlow model with `N` GPUs, you can use the following command. It generates `N x mini-batch size` images each time:

```
accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes N --mixed_precision bf16 demo_t2i.py \
          --config=configs/t2i_512px_clip.py \
          --nnet_path=path/to/t2i_512px_clip_dimr.pth \
          --img_save_path=temp_saved_images \
          --prompt='A dog flying in the sky' \
```
